/*
Write a function named ``createReportObject`` whose parameter, ``employeesList``,
is the return value of the previous function createEmployeesObject:
  IN:
    {
      "departmentName": [
        ...departmentEmployees
      ],
      "departmentName": [
        ...departmentEmployees
      ],
      ...
    }
  ...
  OUT:
    {
      allEmployees: {
        "departmentName": [
          ...departmentEmployees
        ],
        "departmentName": [
          ...departmentEmployees
        ],
        ...
      },
      getNumberOfDepartments(employeesList)
    };

``createReportObject`` should return an object containing the key ``allEmployees``
and a method property called ``getNumberOfDepartments``.

``allEmployees`` is a key that maps to an object containing the department name
and a list of all the employees in that department.
If youâ€™re having trouble, use the spread syntax.

The method property receives ``employeesList`` and returns the number of departments.
I would suggest suggest thinking back to the ES6 method property syntax.

export default function createReportObject(employeesList) {
  return {
    allEmployees: employeesList,
    getNumberOfDepartments(employeesList) {
      return Object.keys(employeesList).length;
    }
  }
}
