"""
Write a Python script that provides some stats
about Nginx logs stored in MongoDB:
    - Database: logs
    - Collection: nginx
    - Display (same as the example):
        - first line: x logs where x is the number of documents
            in this COLLECTION
        - second line: Methods:
        - 5 lines with the number of documents with
            the method = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"]
            in this order (see example below - warning:
                itâ€™s a tabulation before each line)
        - one line with the number of documents with:
            - method=GET
            - path=/status

You can use this dump as data sample: dump.zip
