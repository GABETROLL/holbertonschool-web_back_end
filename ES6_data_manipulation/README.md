# ES6 Data Manipulation
## Usage
### Dependencies
- ``node``
- ``npm``
### Install NPM dependencies
On this directory, in the terminal, run:
```npm install```
### Run Exercises' Main Files
Run
```node #-main.js```
in the terminal, where "``#``" is the exercise number.
### Edit the exercises
In the files that don't end with ```main.js```,
are my solutions to the exercises. Feel free to experiment!
### Lint with ESLINT
In the terminal, run:
```npm run lint ...js```
the "``...``" should be the name of any ``...js``
file in this directory. If you want to lint all of them, use "``*js``". The way I wrote the code should pass the lint for the versions I used. Please let me know if they don't.
